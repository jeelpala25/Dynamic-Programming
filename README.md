# Backtracking Algorithm Implementations

## Overview

This project implements several backtracking algorithms using Python, focusing on well-known problems such as Tower of Hanoi, Rat in a Maze, Combination Sum, N Queens, and Sudoku solving. The program is designed as a command-line application where users can choose which algorithm to run and solve.

## Features

1. **Tower of Hanoi**: A recursive solution to move disks between rods while obeying the game rules.
2. **Rat in a Maze**: A solution to find all possible paths for a rat to navigate through a maze.
3. **Combination Sum**: Finds all unique combinations of a set of numbers that sum to a target value.
4. **N Queen**: Solves the N Queens problem, where N queens are placed on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
5. **Sudoku Solver**: A backtracking-based solution to solve a standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.
6. **Exit**: Exit the program.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies are required.

## Usage

When you run the program, you'll be presented with a menu to choose from the following options:

1. **Tower of Hanoi**: Enter the number of disks and the names of the three poles. The program will output the steps to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.
2. **Rat in the Maze**: The program uses a predefined 4x4 maze and finds all possible paths for the rat to reach the destination.
3. **Combination Sum**: You can input a list of candidate numbers and a target value. The program will return all unique combinations that sum to the target.
4. **N Queen**: Input the size of the chessboard (N), and the program will find and display all solutions to the N Queen problem.
5. **Sudoku**: The program solves a predefined 9x9 Sudoku board using backtracking.
6. **Exit**: Ends the program.
